# HF Markets Landing Page Challenge

A responsive landing page built with **Next.js 15 App Router**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI** – inspired by the provided Figma design for **HF Markets Group**.

## ✅ Completion Status

> 🎯 **~90% functional & visually aligned** with the Figma mockup.

Despite being a full-stack engineer with a backend focus, I implemented this page to match the design as closely as possible while ensuring usability, responsiveness, and clean code.
